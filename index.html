            <section class="personalInfo">I am a man. I have qualities that make me unique from 
                some people but similar to others. I don't enjoy divulging much information about myself,
                due to my private nature. If you wish to get to know me on a more personal level, good luck.
                I live the life of a hermit. It wasn't caused by social isolation but, rather, frugality.
                Why buy food at a restaurant when it is so much cheaper to make at home?

            <section class="dinoInfo">This is a triceratops. They are good because their face is a weapon. 
                They were quite heavy and slow. This speed is due to the fact they ate mostly greens (herbavor). If they 
                ate meat, they might have been bigger and faster. Much like a raptor.
